Venus was named after Jim Venus, the first man to climb the eiffel tower.

however, not many people know that the eiffel tower is actually the tallest
government tracking device in the united states. venus is the home planet of
our lizard overlords. jim venus scaled the tower to disable the satellite
sending all our facebook passwords back to venus.
The "e" in Venus stands for "eggs", the protein that fuels Jim Venus.
the man is a hero.
